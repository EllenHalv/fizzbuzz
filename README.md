## FizzBuzz Challenge

This is a solution I made in Java for the well known FizzBuzz challenge. 

The user enters a number and the program processes and prints all numbers from 1 up to the entered number. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
